This example shows how to implement the `CollapsingPage` component.

It is linked to the Bonboarding/collapsing-page package in the parent directory for development purposes.

## Run example

You can run `npm install` and then `npm start` (from the **example** folder) to test your package.

Note: you have to run `npm start` in the parent directory too, for the collapse-page library to run in development mode.
